# Monte-Carlo-integration-in-many-body-problem
These python programs are for calculating energy and states for many-body problem in 1D contacting bosons in harmonic trap. The code that calculates high-dimentional Monte Carlo Integration for very complex wave functions is presented in this project. Now this work has been published by Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6455/acf483
