# Monte-Carlo-integration-in-many-body-problem
These python programs are for calculating energy and states for many-body problem in 1D contacting bosons in harmonic trap. The code that calculates high-dimentional Monte Carlo Integration for very complex wave functions is presented in this project. Now this work has been accepted by Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. Please read Generator coordinate method for 1D contacting bosons in harmonic trap.pdf for further details.
